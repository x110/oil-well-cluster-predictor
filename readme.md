** The objective is to develop a boilerplate for image classification problems where the whole workflow and  pipelines is implemenyed. This will serve as a jumpboard to build classification applications faster and also provides a unified framework to takle such problems aiding in maintainability**

- [x] split the notebook into .py modules
    - [x] make_dataset.py
    - [x] train.py
        -[x] restructure the end points of train.py
    - [x] evaluation.py
    - [x] write predict.py including the preprocessing pipeline
- [ ] test the complete code





- [ ] fix warning: cuments/ml-projects/oil-well-cluster-predictor/src/transformations.py:112: FutureWarning: DataFrame.fillna with 'method' is deprecated ...
- [ ] add wandb
- [ ] save model in a unique file path
- [x] add gitignore
- [ ] install vs extension TODO
- [x] create a main file to run everything
- [ ] link the play/debug button to the main file






- [ ] add the missing components to the code
    - [ ] config file
    - [ ] experiment tracking using wandb
    - [ ] run it as a script
    - [ ] run it as a pip package
    - [ ] error analysis
    - [ ] APIs
    - [ ] tests
- [ ] refactor:
    - [ ] remove hard coded values to config
    - [ ] check if files exist before generating ones and have an overwrite flag
- [ ] write test functions

    
    - [ ] EDA: Well card
- [ ] Data audit
- [ ] Solve using DL
Bonus:
- [ ] Develop a gui and host it on github.io
